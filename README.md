This software is intended to check the wind conditions in a given place.

It works as follows:
1) it creates a table for each day to be checked;
2) it goes to a website and solves a potential 403 error
3) it parses the data via text analysis and puts them into the tables;
4) it makes the graphic: if wind speed is greater than a given value a red scrabble is displayed and so on...;
5) it works on the days of the week to correctly show "today", "tomorrow" and "the day after tomorrow".
